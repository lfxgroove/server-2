     * This class is used to keep track of which \ref Player s match which. This class is supposed
     * to take care of matching people to other people based on level, what they want to do etc via
     * the \ref Dungeon::GroupProposal::Fits method. And when a full group can be created this
     * class is no longer of any use. It also keeps tracks of how many healers/dps/tanks we have
     * that would be available for this certain group.
     *
     * What decides if we can create a group or not is the
     * \ref Dungeon::GroupProposal::CanCreateFullGroup function which just checks the unique player list.
     *
     * Some ideas in this class: we have three lists for the separate roles you can undertake, the leader
     * one isn't specially interesting as we'll have to assign someone to it, it isn't necessary
     * to create a group. Between these three lists we can have duplicates and such, ie:
     * - tanks: player 1, player 3
     * - healers: player 1, player 2
     * - dps: player 2, player 3, player 4, player 5
     * And we keep a list of all unique \ref Player s, ie:
     * - unique: player 1, player 2, player 3, player 4, player 5
     * When the unique list is filled we should have filled enough spots to be able to create a group,
     * this in turn is enforced by the \ref Dungeon::GroupProposal::Fits only adding people which
     * increase the possibility of creating a group, ie: if we have 3 dps we'll only add healers/tanks,
     * perhaps they've signed up as dps/healer and in that case we will have 4 dps but also a healer so
     * it works out.
