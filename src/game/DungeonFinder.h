     * The base class that's used for finding people a group of other people to be able to do a
     * dungeon together. To understand the idea for this class and the classes related to this
     * one please read a little bit about the dungeon finding system that was introduced in WotLK.
     * 
     * The idea with this class and the ones related to it is that the methods that have a Create
     * somewhere in their name and give back a pointer to a object will generally take care of
     * deallocating the memory allocated, if not it will be noted in the functions documentation.
     *
     * Wait times and their calculation
     * When a the first person starts queueing we start measuring the time it's taken from that person
     * queueing until a actual group forming (if the first person is involved in this group or not
     * doesn't really matter). That will become the first average we have, after that we measure the
     * time it takes for another group to form and so forth. The measuring is done using the
     * \ref MaNGOS::WeightedAverage class which helps in making the math hopefully a little more easy.
     * 
     * The wait times for healer and tanks are pretty much the same, with the difference that we start
     * the counter once the first tank (ever) starts searching, and as soon as a group forms we
     * calculate the average the same way. The same thing goes for dps and healers.
